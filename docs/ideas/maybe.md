# Pub Panic! - Maybe Ideas

These need more design work or depend on scope. Review again later.

---

## Core Mechanics

### Bar Cleaning
Must clean bar after use or risk losing order spot.
**Needs:** Clear consequences defined (customers leave? reduced tips?)

### Rare Rerolls (SAP Sloth)
Small chance for powerful items in store rerolls.
**Needs:** Balance testing to avoid RNG frustration

---

## Difficulty Modifiers

### Social Drinkers
Customers always order multiple drinks.
**Note:** Overlaps with 'Happy Birthday' upgrade - could merge

### Chatty Crowd
Customers take 2x longer to order/pay. Creates line pressure.
**Note:** Merged concept from Chatty Drinkers + Chatty Customers + Curious Customers

### Mumblers
Customer orders partially obscured/harder to read.
**Needs:** Careful visual design, accessibility consideration

---

## Upgrades

### DDR Discount
Rhythm minigame in store for purchase discounts. Diagetic (like piano in Big).
**Had:** Partial implementation (lost to git)
**Needs:** Full design spec

### Credit Line / Loan Shark
Missing rent triggers debt instead of game over.
**Needs:** Debt recovery mechanics defined

### VIP Area / Red Carpet
Separate area with own register. VIPs order most complex drinks.
**Needs:** Multi-block placement system

### Automatic Drink Maker
Set recipe, feed ingredients, outputs drinks. Holds 3 of each ingredient.
**Needs:** Balance vs other automation

### Tablet Ordering
Customers order via tablet, pick up later. Slower patience loss while waiting.
**Needs:** Major system design

### Bartending Robot
Upgrade tablet to auto-make drinks.
**Needs:** Balance (slow? limited drinks?)

### Cash Only
Customers pay cash, player must deposit.
**Needs:** Could tie into other cash mechanics

---

## Customer Behavior

### Fire Code / Capacity
Max customers inside, rest wait outside (slower patience loss).
**Needs:** Club theme dependency

### Bouncer
Turns away half the customers.
**Needs:** Theme integration, clear trade-off

### Tourist
Customers accept any valid recipe (don't know what they want).
**Needs:** Visual indicator design

---

## Drinks

### Craft Beer / Flights
More beer options + flight tray (4 unique beers).
**Needs:** Beer variety content

### Boba / Bubble Tea
Visual variety drink.
**Needs:** Scope decision

### Ice Cream / Float
Scoops + soda floats.
**Needs:** Scope decision

### Crafting Beer/Wine
Player makes alcohol via fermentation.
**Note:** Major scope expansion, fundamentally different gameplay

---

## Events & Themes

### Weather Effects
Weather changes customer drink preferences.
**Needs:** UI to show weather, drink preference mapping

### Themed Nights
Special event nights (karaoke night, disco night).
**Needs:** Event system, customer preference changes

---

## Misc

### Merch (hats/shirts)
Sell merch, returning customers wear it.
**Note:** Cute but low priority

### Gacha Machine / Card Packs
Random item acquisition.
**Note:** Could feel unfair, needs careful design
