# Pub Panic! - Definite Ideas

These are features that will be implemented.

---

## Core Systems

### Conveyer Belts / Tractor Beam
Move items automatically between stations. Already partially implemented. Essential for late-game automation.

### Drunk Customers
Customers who've been drinking behave differently (stumble, wrong orders, slower). Ties into existing bladder/vomit systems.

### Happy Hour
2x customers mid-day, 0.75x prices. Creates 'rush hour' dynamic. Simple config change.

---

## Upgrades

### Jukebox
Customers pay to use. Passive income furniture. Easy to implement.

### Try This Display
Place drink to encourage customers to order it. Gives player agency over what customers want.

### Regulars
Repeat customers who always order same thing. One per unlocked drink.
**Design note:** Should have trade-off - lower base price but better tips.

### Utility Billing
Machines 25% cheaper but incur daily operational costs. Economic depth for experienced players.

### Draughts Station with Auto-fill
Beer tap that auto-fills when cup placed. Automation upgrade.

### Bathroom Upgrades
Break the Seal, Luxury Lavatories, Bidet - various bathroom mechanics need more depth.

---

## Drinks

### Tea / Coffee
Hot beverages with pot + water. Similar to existing mechanics, easy content expansion.

### Pitcher
Groups order together, one pitcher holds 10 of same drink. Bulk serving, reduces trips.

### Champagne
Sword opening minigame (QTE). Bigger tips for perfect.
**Design note:** Need to solve how to hold sword + bottle.

### Frozen Drinks
Blender furniture for frozen versions of existing drinks. New equipment, same recipes.

### Mocktails
Secretly replace alcohol with soda. Faster prep but risk of getting caught?

---

## Themes

### Big City / Small Town
Global modifiers per run. Big city = less patience, 2x prices. Small town = inverse.

---

## Furniture (needs renaming)

### [Rename] Order Copy Machine (was: Karaoke)
Customers visit and order same as previous customer. Creates ordering patterns.
**Note:** Name doesn't fit the mechanic - find better name.

### [Rename] Drink Preserver (was: Vacuum Sealer)
Save one drink between days. Simple QoL prep mechanic.
**Note:** Name doesn't fit - find better name.
