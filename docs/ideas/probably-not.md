# Pub Panic! - Probably Not

These ideas are out of scope, too complex, or don't fit the game.

---

## Cut List

### Small / Medium / Large Bottle Sizes
Adds complexity without clear gameplay benefit.

### Generic Stocking System (pallets, shelf refills)
Too simulation-heavy, doesn't match arcade feel.

### Player Item Exchange
Dropping items works fine. Conveyers solve long-distance transfer better.

### SpeedWalkers Modifier
Pure difficulty increase without interesting counterplay.

### Pure Debuffs (Bad Insurance / Bad Fins)
Make less money or walk slower - not fun, just harder.

### Dynamic Prices
Longer queues = higher prices. Could create perverse incentive to let lines build.

### Theft + Metal Detectors
Creates vigilance gameplay but adds complexity for minimal fun.

### Trivia Night
Customers ask trivia with orders. Outside core loop.

### Robots (undefined)
Too vague. MopBuddy already exists for automation.

### Sticky Hand (undefined)
No clear purpose defined.

### Me and Mrs Jones
Double customers but some take others home. Confusing mechanic.

### Pub Crawl
Groups order only beers. Redundant with other group mechanics.

### Self Medicated
Customers order spirits only. Limiting rather than challenging.
