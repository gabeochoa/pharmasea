Pharmasea is a simulation game where players manage a pharmacy that caters to fish. As the owner of the pharmacy, players must keep their fish customers healthy by correctly diagnosing their ailments and providing the appropriate medications.

Once their pharmacy is open for business, fish customers will visit with various health problems. Players must carefully listen to the fish\textquotesingle{}s symptoms and use their knowledge of fish diseases and treatments to diagnose and prescribe the correct medication.

Players must manage their inventory to ensure they always have the right medicines on hand, and they must carefully balance their resources to keep the pharmacy running smoothly. This may involve hiring and training staff, advertising to attract more customers, and upgrading the pharmacy\textquotesingle{}s equipment.

Throughout the game, players will encounter challenges and special events that test their skills as a pharmacist.
