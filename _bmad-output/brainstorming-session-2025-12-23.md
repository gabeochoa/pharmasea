# Game Brainstorming Session

## Session Info

- **Date:** 2025-12-23
- **Facilitator:** Game Designer Agent
- **Participant:** choicehoney

## Brainstorming Approach

**Selected Mode:** Guided (with Advanced Elicitation Synergies)

**Techniques Available:**
- MDA Framework
- Player Fantasy Mining
- Core Loop Design
- Genre Mashup
- Emotion Mapping
- Moment Design
- Flow Analysis
- Constraint Box
- Reference Blending
- What If Scenarios

**Synergy Combos Approved:**
1. **The "Automatic Scramble"** (Core Loop + Genre Mashup) - identifying friction points to automate.
2. **The "Bar God" Peaks** (Player Fantasy + Moment Design) - mapping hit-impact beats.
3. **"Stress-Free Scaling"** (Flow Analysis + MDA Framework) - balancing pressure vs. flow.

**Focus Areas:**
- Core Gameplay Loop
- Player Fantasy
- Game Mechanics
- Game Dynamics
- Aesthetic Experience
- Progression Systems
- Challenge and Difficulty
- Social/Multiplayer Features
- Narrative and World
- Art Direction and Feel

## Ideas Generated

### Concept: The "High-Wire Performer" + "Bottleneck Spotter"
**Source Technique:** Player Fantasy Mining / Automatic Scramble Synergy
**Description:** No editing during rounds. Player focus is 100% on perfect execution (serving, clearing jams). Bottleneck identification is **Purely Emergent & Physical**—the player observes the bar's literal state (piles, slow lines) with no special UI or tools.
**Potential:** Massive. Deepens the value of the Sun/Night loop transition.
**Build-on ideas:** Physical signs of machine "stress" (steam, sparks), literal "item piles" that spill onto the floor (The Jam).

---

### Concept: MDA Framework Breakdown - "The Relief Loop"
**Source Technique:** MDA Framework Exploration
**Aesthetics (Feel):** Relief upon surviving the day, followed immediately by "Fixer's Excitement" (planning the next shop visit/optimization).
**Dynamics (Behavior):** Emergent "Throughput Mastery"—players naturally learn to read the bar's flow and anticipate automation needs.
**Mechanics (The Bottleneck):** The primary failure state is **Customer Patience**. Clogs in the system (The Jam) lead directly to customers leaving or the **"Piss-on-floor" penalty**, creating a manual cleaning scramble.
**Potential:** High. Validates the "Day/Night" cycle as the core tension releaser.
**Build-on ideas:** Teleporters for high-complexity drinks (Mojitos), "Patience Buff" items for the queue.

---

### Concept: The "Draft Shop" (Factorio x Deckbuilder)
**Source Technique:** Genre Mashup
**Description:** The shop phase uses a "Draft" or "Deckbuilder" style selection where players are presented with a limited selection of machines/upgrades each night. This forces creative builds based on what's available rather than buying the same "optimal" build every run.
**Potential:** High. Increases replayability and makes each night's "Relief" turn into a strategic gamble.
**Build-on ideas:** "Extra Machine" slots, "Reroll" shop items, "Rare/Legendary" automation parts.

---

## Themes and Patterns

- **Physicality and Emergence:** Everything should be visible in the world (messes, jams, stress).
- **Survival via Automation:** The rent is the motivator; automation is the only way to survive.
- **Skillful Observation:** The player's main job during the day is to be the "Sensor" for the bar's health.

---

## Brief Critique Results (Party Mode)

### Shredded (Burn List)
- **Cup Lifecycle:** Removed manual overhead.
- **Trivia Night:** Removed to protect the "Flow State."
- **Weather Effects:** Removed to focus on physical bar layout.

### Refined Features
- **Bidet:** Re-imagined as a bathroom capacity/mess-reduction upgrade (rather than auto-cleaning/frequency buff).

---

## Session Complete

The session has provided a clear direction: **Physicality, Emergence, and Throughput Mastery.**
The next step is to lock these into the GDD or start prototyping.
