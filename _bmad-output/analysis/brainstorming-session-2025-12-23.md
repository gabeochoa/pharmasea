# Brainstorming Session Results: Pub Panic!

**Original Code Name:** pharmasea
**Final Title:** Pub Panic!
**Genre:** Systemic Volume Roguelite
**Facilitator:** choicehoney
**Date:** 2025-12-23

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Game Design & Direction for "Pub Panic!"
**Goals:** Transition from a collection of features to a cohesive, story-driven, and fun game plan inspired by *PlateUp!* and *Overcooked*.


### Context Guidance

_I have loaded the Agent Creation Brainstorming Context. We will focus on discovering the essence of your BMAD agent - their identity (name, personality), voice, purpose (problem solved, killer feature, command menu), and architecture type (Specialist, Domain Master, or Team Player)._

## Technique Execution Results

### Phase 1: First Principles Thinking (CONCLUDED)

**The Final Core Truth:**
- **Genre:** Systemic Volume Roguelite.
- **Fail Condition:** "The Rent" (Weekly financial targets). Failure to pay means the landlord shuts you down.
- **Player Tension:** Maximum Throughput. Success isn't "Perfect Service," it's "Maximum Volume."
- **The Loop:** Manual Scrambling (Days) → Strategic Upgrading/Automation (Nights) → Increasing Complexity/Rent (Progression).

---

### Phase 2: Metaphor Mapping (CONCLUDED & PIVOTED)

**The Anchor:** **The Urban Bar Hustle**
- **The Core Reality:** It’s a bar in the city. You have features, but you need a "Game."
- **The Pressure:** Escalating Rent. If you don't hit the volume, you get evicted.
- **The Aesthetic:** Urban, chaotic, energetic. (As per user request: "Just a bar in a city").

**Mechanic Mapping:**
- **Serving Drinks:** Income to pay the landlord.
- **The Rent:** The weekly survival target.
- **Automation:** Not just for ease, but for **Solo Playability**.
- **Single Player:** The game must scale so a solo player can manage the floor through layout and automation.

**Facilitation Note:** By grounding this in reality, we focus on the **Solo vs. Co-op** balance. Automation becomes the "teammate" for a solo player.

---

## Final Brainstorming Summary: Pub Panic!

**Pub Panic!** is a high-energy **Systemic Volume Roguelite** set in a realistic, chaotic urban bar. 

### The Core Vision:
- **Fans of Overcooked/PlateUp!:** The game targets players who love high-intensity, coordination-based management with deep strategic layers.
- **The Failure Condition:** "The Rent is Due." If player throughput doesn't match the escalating weekly financial targets, the landlord shuts you down.
- **Realistic Craft:** All drinks use real recipes and ingredients, adding a layer of authenticity to the chaos.
- **The Solo/Co-op Bridge:** Handled through a **Choice-driven Upgrade System**. Solo players prioritize automation and layout efficiency, while co-op players lean into chaotic multi-person coordination.
- **The Progression:** Manual Scrambling (Days) -> Systems Building (Nights) -> Increasing Complexity (Weeks).

**Brainstorming Concluded. Ready for Agent Discovery.**

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Game Design & Direction for "pharmasea" with focus on Transition from a collection of features to a cohesive, story-driven, and fun game plan.

**Recommended Techniques:**

- **First Principles Thinking:** Strip away assumptions to find the core "truth" of what makes the game unique and fun.
- **Metaphor Mapping:** Use a concrete metaphor to anchor the story and "soul" of the game.
- **SCAMPER Method:** Systematically audit existing features to determine what survives the transition.

## Technique Selection: Agent Discovery

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Agent Creation for "Pub Panic!" with focus on Discovering the identity, voice, purpose, and architecture.

**Recommended Techniques:**

- **Persona Journey:** Discover the agent's identity and voice by inhabiting their character.
- **Analogical Thinking:** Define the agent's purpose and killer feature by drawing parallels to other domains.
- **SCAMPER Method:** Refine the agent's functions and architecture for optimal utility.

**AI Rationale:** This sequence moves from the "WHO" (Identity/Voice) to the "WHAT" (Purpose/Functions) to the "HOW" (Architecture/Refinement), ensuring a cohesive agent design.

## Technique Execution Results: Persona Journey (IN PROGRESS)

### Element 1: The First Impression (Identity)

**Visual Identity:** 
- A classic Scottish farmer type.
- **Attire:** Plaid and tweed, flat cap.
- **Signature Trait:** Always has a pipe (leaving a trail of heather smoke).
- **Communication Style:** **The Silent Stoic.** He doesn't talk. His "voice" is found in his actions, his presence, and the way he manages the pub without a single word.

### Element 2: Non-Verbal Voice (Presence)

**Facilitation Note:** Since he is silent, his personality is expressed through "stoic utility." Instead of catchphrases, he has "signature gestures" or "functional cues."

## Pivot: Feature Brainstorming

**Date:** 2025-12-23 (Continuation)
**Topic:** Narrowing down and refining features for "Pub Panic!"
**Goals:** 
- Review the extensive list of ideas in `ideas.md` and `progression_tree.md`.
- Determine the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) features.
- Define a clear progression path (Upgrades, Themes, Drinks).
- Focus on solo-playability vs. co-op balance.

**Current Context:**
I have reviewed `ideas.md` (Ailments, Ailment solutions, Pharmacy/Bar mechanics, Difficulty modifiers) and `progression_tree.md` (Upgrades like DDR, Plunger minigame, Five-finger discount, Speakeasy, etc.). We are now ready to refine these into the "Pub Panic!" framework.

---

## Technique Selection: Feature Refinement

**Approach:** Random Technique Selection
**Selection Method:** Serendipitous discovery from 36+ techniques

**Randomly Selected Techniques:**

- **Forced Relationships:** Colliding game mechanics with random objects to find unique "Roguelite" power-ups.
- **Drunk History Retelling:** Stripping away the ECS complexity to find the "coolest bar ever" story.
- **Constraint Mapping:** Grounding the wild ideas in the reality of Solo vs. Co-op balance and development time.

**Random Discovery Story:** We chose the path of creative serendipity to break out of usual thinking patterns. The combination of high-chaos "Forced Relationships" and the grounding focus of "Constraint Mapping" provides a perfect arc for defining our MVP.

---

## Technique Execution Results

### Phase 1: Forced Relationships (IN PROGRESS)

**The Challenge:** We take existing features and collide them with unexpected items to see what "Roguelite" sparks fly.

**Key Design Principles (Established by User):**
- **Fungible Customers:** No complex individual stats or traits; keep the focus on volume.
- **Unlimited Ingredients:** Messing up shouldn't be devastating; the challenge should be speed/throughput.
- **Volume over Complexity:** Avoid feature bloat; favor deep/replayable core loops.

**Collision 1: Mixing + DDR/Rhythm (THE WINNER)**
- **Concept:** "Overclocking" machines through a rhythm-based minigame.
- **Mechanism:** When blending/shaking, the player can hit a rhythm sequence.
- **Client-Side Action:** Only the player at the machine performs the rhythm.
- **Global Reward:** A successful "Perfect" combo triggers a map-wide boost (e.g., "Frenzy") that benefits all players (speed boost, instant automation for X seconds).
- **Failure:** A "Spill" occurs, requiring a short mop-up.

---

### Analysis: Current Upgrades & Global Boosts

I have reviewed the current `progression_tree.md` and `ideas.md`. The design goal is **Global Map-Wide Boosts**.

**Existing Global Boost Patterns:**
- **Economic Boosts:** `Happy Hour` (2x spawn, 0.75x price), `$10k beer` (0.5x spawn, 2x price).
- **Utility Boosts:** `Luxury Lavatories` (higher orders, needs hand wash), `Dynamic Prices` (line length = price).
- **Automation / Logistics:** `Conveyor belts`, `Tractor beam`, `Bartending Robot`.

**New Integration (Rhythm-Triggered):**
- **Frenzy (The Global Reward):** Successfully performing manual tasks (Rhythm Mixing) builds a shared meter. When it pops, the entire bar operates at 2x efficiency for all players.

---

### Phase 2: Drunk History Retelling (CONCLUDED)

**The Soul of "Pub Panic!":**
> "Frantic running a bar with your friends. It's just like Overcooked but you can eventually automate parts of it."

**Killer Insights:**
- **The Pivot Point:** The game isn't just about manual chaos; it's about the **transition** from manual (Overcooked-style) to automated (Factorio-style).
- **Automation is the Goal:** Players aren't just working the bar; they are building a machine that works the bar for them.
- **Frantic Collaboration:** Friends aren't just helpers; they are systems integrators who scramble to fill the gaps in the machines.

---

### Phase 3: Constraint Mapping (IN PROGRESS)

**The Challenge:** We have a massive list of ideas. We need to filter them through our constraints to find the **MVP Feature Set**.

**Core Constraints:**
1. **Solo vs. Co-op Balance**: Must be playable solo through automation, but fun in co-op through chaos.
2. **Technical Scope**: Raylib/C++ ECS project. Prefer systemic depth over asset bloat.
3. **Fungible/Unlimited**: No complex economy for individual items; focus on total volume.

**MVP Feature Lock Attempt:**
- **Manual Mastery**: Rhythm Mixing (Overclocking machines).
- **Core Automation**: Conveyor Belts, Shaker/Blender Automation modules.
- **The Pressure**: The Rent system (Weekly financial targets).
- **The Map**: Dynamic/Randomized pub layouts that force different automation builds.
- **[CUT] Persistence**: The Locker (Removed to focus on the "per-round" urgency and systemic volume).

**Final Reflection:** By removing the locker, we reinforce the Roguelite nature—each run starts fresh, and your success depends on how you adapt to that day's layout and rent targets.

## Idea Organization and Prioritization

### Thematic clusters

I've analyzed all the generated ideas to identify natural themes that will define the "Pub Panic!" experience.

**Theme 1: Manual Mastery & Flow**
_Focus: The "Overcooked" style frantic starting point where player skill directly impacts throughput._
- **Rhythm Mixing (DDR-style):** The core mechanic for manual overclocking.
- **The "Spill" System:** The immediate failure penalty for missing the rhythm.
- **Global Frenzy Boost:** The "God-tier" reward for consistent manual excellence.

**Theme 2: Systemic Automation & Logistics**
_Focus: The "Factorio" style progression where players transition from manual labor to systems management._
- **Conveyor Belts / Tractor Beams:** The fundamental transport layer.
- **Automation Modules:** Upgrades that turn manual machines (blenders/shakers) into auto-running components.
- **Map-Wide Boosts:** Upgrades that affect the entire systemic machine at once.

**Theme 3: The Roguelite Pressure Loop**
_Focus: The high-stakes environment that forces adaptation and creates tension._
- **The Rent:** The weekly survival target that scales with your success.
- **Dynamic Layouts:** Randomized bar setups that dictate your automation strategy.
- **Total Resets:** No persistence (Locker cut) to maintain the "run" intensity.

### Breakthrough Concept
**The Manual-to-Auto Pivot:** The most innovative aspect of this session is the discovery that **Rhythm Mixing** isn't just a minigame—it's the bridge that makes the manual labor feel rewarding enough to keep doing until you finally earn the prestige of automation.
