## TODOs  

|design decisions|broke|
|----------------|-----|
|hard to tell that a new machine/stockpile has been spawned in after you get an upgrade|Client player cant change settings because menu::State is being overriden by host|
|Simple Syrup doesnt dissapear after one use and its kinda the only one that does that…|Automatically teleport new players when joining InRound / Planning etc|
|During planning its hard to know what each machine it, not obvious|default language is reverse which is confusing|
|Need a recipe book|PS4 Controller touchpad causing “mouse camera rotation”<br>clicking the touchpad & analog stick in the opposite direction cam rotates that way|
|revamp the names|- bug where you cant place the table next to the register<br>- => (i’ve disable bounds checking on placement for now)|
|penalty if you make too much extra? waste too much ingredients|at round 3 the people got stuck in line as if there was an invis person at the front|
|highlight spots on the map where this thing can go|BUG: Hide pause buttons from non-host since they dont really do anything anyway|
|Text doesnt rotate based on the camera|BUG: When host opens settings, probably dont bring everyone else too|

## End TODO 


## Changelog

if youd like to try a specific version, the easiest way is to use gitblame to find the commit the changelog line was added
and then just checkout that hash (sorry im not doing releases / tags atm) 

I am publishing some releases on itch, you can find the url in the code or build the game and click the itch.io icon.
