Core engine TODOs:
1. Allow an Entity to pick up / drop an Item
2. ~~Fix A* algorithm~~
3. Allow for an Item to be walkable or not (influences Entity movement)
4. Create Doors
5. Create Nav mesh for "walkability"
6. Add new target entity that moves via arrows keys / alternative keys

Gameplay Ideas
- Pharmacy
    - AI players need status conditions ("Ailments")
    - Small / Medium / Large perscription size
    - Label Dosage on the bag / pill bottle?
    - Generic medication stocking
    - Cashier? (Part of job?)
    - Auto-weigher? / Conveyer belts or tractor beam
    - Phone will ring from doctor with perscription information (Include key bindings for picking up the phone)
    - Phone will ring from clients with questions about whether or not their perscription is ready
    - Allow to put people on hold?
    - Cleaning tools after use, otherwise risk contamination
    - Clients will have to have distinct names
    - Difficulty modifiers at end of day (Like Plateup's)?
