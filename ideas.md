Planning and preparing in advance for these themed nights would be essential to ensure customer satisfaction and maximize earnings.

Weather Effects:
Weather conditions can impact the behavior of customers, making the game more dynamic and challenging. On rainy days, customers might seek comforting warm drinks, like hot toddies or mulled wine, while on hot days, they may prefer refreshing cocktails and mocktails. Additionally, extreme weather like storms could cause more customers to seek shelter in the bar, leading to sudden rushes of orders that players must handle efficiently.
